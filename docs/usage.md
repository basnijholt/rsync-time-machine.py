                          src_folder dest_folder [exclusion_file]

A script for creating and managing time-stamped backups using rsync.

positional arguments:
  src_folder            Source folder for backup. Format: [USER@HOST:]SOURCE
  dest_folder           Destination folder for backup. Format:
                        [USER@HOST:]DESTINATION
  exclusion_file        Path to the file containing exclude patterns. Cannot
                        be used together with `--exclude-from`.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p, --port PORT       SSH port.
  -i, --id_rsa ID_RSA   Specify the private ssh key to use.
  --rsync-get-flags     Display the default rsync flags that are used for
                        backup. If using remote drive over SSH, --compress
                        will be added.
  --rsync-set-flags RSYNC_SET_FLAGS
                        Set the rsync flags that are going to be used for
                        backup.
  --rsync-append-flags RSYNC_APPEND_FLAGS
                        Append the rsync flags that are going to be used for
                        backup.
  --log-dir LOG_DIR     Set the log file directory. If this flag is set,
                        generated files will not be managed by the script - in
                        particular they will not be automatically deleted.
                        Default: $HOME/.rsync-time-backup
  --strategy STRATEGY   Set the expiration strategy. Default: "1:1 30:7
                        365:30" means after one day, keep one backup per day.
                        After 30 days, keep one backup every 7 days. After 365
                        days keep one backup every 30 days.
  --no-auto-expire      Disable automatically deleting backups when out of
                        space. Instead, an error is logged, and the backup is
                        aborted.
  --allow-host-only     By default, the script expects a 'USER@HOST' pattern
                        for specifying SSH connections. When this flag is
                        used, it allows for the 'HOST' pattern without a
                        specified user. This is useful if you want to use
                        configurations from the `.ssh/config` file or rely on
                        the current username. Note: this option will not
                        enforce SSH usage, it only broadens the accepted input
                        formats.
  --dry-run             Simulate the backup process without making any
                        persistent changes.
  --exclude-from EXCLUDE_FROM
                        Path to the file containing exclude patterns.
                        Alternative to the positional `exclusion_file`. Not to
                        be used with `exclusion_file`.
  -v, --verbose         Enable verbose output. This will slow down the backup
                        process (in simple tests by 2x).

## Exclusion File

<!-- CODE:START -->

An optional exclude file can be provided as a third parameter, compatible with the `--exclude-from` parameter of rsync.

The `--exclude-from` option in `rsync-time-machine.py` allows you to exclude specific files or directories from the backup process. You can provide an exclusion file containing patterns for files or directories that should be excluded.

<details>
<summary>📖🔽 Click here to expand the docs on <code>--exclude-from</code> 🔽📖</summary>

Here's how to use the `--exclude-from` feature in `rsync-time-machine.py`:

1. Create a text file named `exclusion_file.txt` (or any other name you prefer) in your preferred location.
2. Add the exclusion patterns to the file, one pattern per line. Patterns can be literal strings, wildcards, or character ranges.
3. Save the file.

To use this exclusion file while performing a backup with `rsync-time-machine.py`, include it as the third positional argument in your command (or with `--exclude-from exclusion_file.txt`). For example:

```bash
rsync-time-machine.py /home /mnt/backup_drive exclusion_file.txt
```

In this example, `/home` is the source folder, `/mnt/backup_drive` is the destination folder, and `exclusion_file.txt` contains the exclude patterns.

Here's a sample `exclusion_file.txt`:

```
+ /home/.fileA
- /home/.*
- /home/junk/
```

In this example:

- `+ /home/.fileA`: Include the file `.fileA` from the `home` directory.
- `- /home/.*`: Exclude all hidden files (files starting with a dot) from the `home` directory.
- `- /home/junk/`: Exclude the entire `junk` directory from the `home` directory.

Remember that the order of patterns matters, as rsync reads the file top-down and acts on the first matching pattern it encounters.

The script is designed so that only one backup operation can be active for a given directory, avoiding conflicts.

To display, add, or remove rsync options, use the `--rsync-get-flags`, `--rsync-append-flags`, or `--rsync-set-flags` options.

## How to Restore

<!-- CODE:START -->
<!-- from generate import readme_section -->
<!-- print(readme_section("restore")) -->
<!-- CODE:END -->
<!-- OUTPUT:START -->
<!-- ⚠️ This content is auto-generated by `markdown-code-runner`. -->
Restoring files from the backup is simple, as the script creates a backup in a regular directory. You can easily copy the files back to the original directory using a command like:

```
rsync -aP /path/to/last/backup/ /path/to/restore/to/
```

Consider using the `--dry-run` option to check what exactly is going to be copied. If you want to delete files that exist in the destination but not in the backup, use the `--delete` option. Be extra cautious when using this option to avoid data loss.

You can also restore files using any file explorer, including Finder on macOS or the command line.
