Introducing `rsync-time-machine.py` - a Python port of the [`rsync-time-backup`](https://github.com/laurent22/rsync-time-backup) script, offering Time Machine-style backups using rsync. It creates incremental backups of files and directories to the destination of your choice. The backups are structured in a way that makes it easy to recover any file at any point in time. 🚀

It works on Linux, macOS, and Windows (via WSL or Cygwin). The main advantage over Time Machine is flexibility, as it can backup from/to any filesystem and works on any platform. You can also backup to a Truecrypt drive without any problem. 😃

`rsync-time-machine.py` is fully tested, has no external dependencies (only Python ≥3.7 🐍), is fully compatible with [`rsync-time-backup`](https://github.com/laurent22/rsync-time-backup), offers pretty terminal output, and is fully typed! 🎉

* 📁 Each backup is in its own folder named after the current timestamp.
* 🔒 Backup to/from remote destinations over SSH.
* 🔗 Files that haven't changed from one backup to the next are hard-linked to the previous backup, saving space.
* ⚠️ Safety check - the backup will only happen if the destination has explicitly been marked as a backup destination.
* 🔄 Resume feature - if a backup has failed or was interrupted, the tool will resume from there on the next backup.
* 🚫 Exclude file - support for pattern-based exclusion via the `--exclude-from` rsync parameter.
* 🧹 Automatically purge old backups based on a configurable expiration strategy.
* 🔗 "latest" symlink that points to the latest successful backup.
