Introducing `rsync-time-machine.py` - a Python port of the [`rsync-time-backup`](https://github.com/laurent22/rsync-time-backup) script, offering Time Machine-style backups using rsync. It creates incremental backups of files and directories to the destination of your choice. The backups are structured in a way that makes it easy to recover any file at any point in time. üöÄ

It works on Linux, macOS, and Windows (via WSL or Cygwin). The main advantage over Time Machine is flexibility, as it can backup from/to any filesystem and works on any platform. You can also backup to a Truecrypt drive without any problem. üòÉ

`rsync-time-machine.py` is fully tested, has no external dependencies (only Python ‚â•3.7 üêç), is fully compatible with [`rsync-time-backup`](https://github.com/laurent22/rsync-time-backup), offers pretty terminal output, and is fully typed! üéâ

## :star2: Features

* üìÅ Each backup is in its own folder named after the current timestamp.
* üîí Backup to/from remote destinations over SSH.
* üîó Files that haven't changed from one backup to the next are hard-linked to the previous backup, saving space.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety check - the backup will only happen if the destination has explicitly been marked as a backup destination.
* üîÑ Resume feature - if a backup has failed or was interrupted, the tool will resume from there on the next backup.
* üö´ Exclude file - support for pattern-based exclusion via the `--exclude-from` rsync parameter.
* üßπ Automatically purge old backups based on a configurable expiration strategy.
* üîó "latest" symlink that points to the latest successful backup.

## :books: Usage

```
Shows the help message:

<!-- CODE:BASH:START -->

```bash
usage: rsync-time-machine [-h] [-p PORT] [-i ID_RSA] [--rsync-get-flags]
                          [--rsync-set-flags RSYNC_SET_FLAGS]
                          [--rsync-append-flags RSYNC_APPEND_FLAGS]
                          [--log-dir LOG_DIR] [--strategy STRATEGY]
                          [--no-auto-expire] [--allow-host-only] [-v]
                          src_folder dest_folder [exclusion_file]

A script for creating and managing time-stamped backups using rsync.

positional arguments:
  src_folder            Source folder for backup. Format: [USER@HOST:]SOURCE
  dest_folder           Destination folder for backup. Format:
                        [USER@HOST:]DESTINATION
  exclusion_file        Path to the file containing exclude patterns.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p PORT, --port PORT  SSH port.
  -i ID_RSA, --id_rsa ID_RSA
                        Specify the private ssh key to use.
  --rsync-get-flags     Display the default rsync flags that are used for
                        backup. If using remote drive over SSH, --compress
                        will be added.
  --rsync-set-flags RSYNC_SET_FLAGS
                        Set the rsync flags that are going to be used for
                        backup.
  --rsync-append-flags RSYNC_APPEND_FLAGS
                        Append the rsync flags that are going to be used for
                        backup.
  --log-dir LOG_DIR     Set the log file directory. If this flag is set,
                        generated files will not be managed by the script - in
                        particular they will not be automatically deleted.
                        Default: $HOME/.rsync-time-backup
  --strategy STRATEGY   Set the expiration strategy. Default: "1:1 30:7
                        365:30" means after one day, keep one backup per day.
                        After 30 days, keep one backup every 7 days. After 365
                        days keep one backup every 30 days.
  --no-auto-expire      Disable automatically deleting backups when out of
                        space. Instead, an error is logged, and the backup is
                        aborted.
  --allow-host-only     By default, the script expects a 'USER@HOST' pattern
                        for specifying SSH connections. When this flag is
                        used, it allows for the 'HOST' pattern without a
                        specified user. This is useful if you want to use
                        configurations from the `.ssh/config` file or rely on
                        the current username. Note: this option will not
                        enforce SSH usage, it only broadens the accepted input
                        formats.
  -v, --verbose         Enable verbose output.
```

Please refer to the original [`rsync-time-backup`](https://github.com/laurent22/rsync-time-backup) README for a list of options, as they have been preserved in the Python port.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Installation

To install `rsync-time-machine.py`, simply clone the repository:

```bash
pip install rsync-time-machine
```

and use it like `rsync-time-machine --help`

Or just copy the script to your computer:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/basnijholt/rsync-time-machine.py/main/rsync_time_machine.py
```
and use it like `./rsync_time_machine.py --help`

## :bulb: Examples

* Backup the home folder to backup_drive:

```
./rsync_time_machine.py /home /mnt/backup_drive
```

* Backup with exclusion list:

```
./rsync_time_machine.py /home /mnt/backup_drive excluded_patterns.txt
```

For more examples and detailed usage instructions, please refer to the original [`rsync-time-backup`](https://github.com/laurent22/rsync-time-backup) README.

## :calendar: Backup Expiration Logic

Backup sets are automatically deleted following a simple expiration strategy defined with the `--strategy` flag. The default strategy is `1:1 30:7 365:30`. Please see the original README for a detailed explanation.

## :page_facing_up: Exclusion File

An optional exclude file can be provided as a third parameter, compatible with the `--exclude-from` parameter of rsync.

## :lock: Built-in Lock

The script is designed so that only one backup operation can be active for a given directory, avoiding conflicts.

## :gear: Rsync Options

To display, add, or remove rsync options, use the `--rsync-get-flags`, `--rsync-append-flags`, or `--rsync-set-flags` options.

## :no_entry_sign: No Automatic Backup Expiration

Use the `--no-auto-expire` flag to disable the default behavior of purging old backups when out of space.

## :arrows_counterclockwise: How to Restore

Restoring files from the backup is simple, as the script creates a backup in a regular directory. You can easily copy the files back to the original directory using a command like:

```
rsync -aP /path/to/last/backup/ /path/to/restore/to/
```

Consider using the `--dry-run` option to check what exactly is going to be copied. If you want to delete files that exist in the destination but not in the backup, use the `--delete` option. Be extra cautious when using this option to avoid data loss.

You can also restore files using any file explorer, including Finder on macOS or the command line.

## :heart: Support and Contributions
